      <description>Hi there! My name is Srishti. I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher broadly interested in two research areas:
Alignment of Language Models (For example: While, in theory, SFT teaches the models to lie and RLHF helps get around this by virtue of Reward Models, how well do RMs work for this purpose?) Techniques for efficient training of and inference from Language Models (Towards this, I am learning GPU Programming and design these days) Work Currently, I am working as an ML Engineer at an Indian startup where I work on many things ML + software engineering including fine-tuning language models for focussed use cases, building evaluation and training pipelines etc.</description>
