### About
Hi there! My name is Srishti and I am a Research Scholar at Cohere.

Below is a subset of things I'm currently the most interested in:
- Mixture of Experts models 
- Techniques for efficient training of and inference from Language Models
- Hardware Design (Questions that can be answered truly on a hardware level eg. Why exactly is it hard to increase the memory bandwidth of CPUs?)
- CUDA programming
- RL theory (I've heard it's hard to make RL work in practice and I haven't gotten a chance to extensively work with it in practical settings but it's so fun to study!)
- Fast and Efficient Distributed Systems

I am best reached via [twitter](https://twitter.com/sGx_tweets) or [email](mailto:srishtigureja1110@gmail.com).
