### About
Hi! My name is Srishti and I am an ML Research Engineer.

Below are some things I'm currently the most interested in:
- MoEs 
- Techniques for efficient training of and inference from Language Models
- Hardware Design and its implications (Questions that can be answered truly on a hardware level eg. Why exactly is it hard to increase the memory bandwidth of CPUs?)
- RL theory (I know from people of twitter that it's hard to make RL work in practice and I haven't gotten a chance to extensively work with it in practical settings, but it's so fun to study!)

I was a Research Scholar at Cohere until July of 2025 where I worked on [improving codegen models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20837). I've since taken a short break and will be looking for new roles beginning Jan 2025.  

I am best reached via [twitter](https://twitter.com/srishti_gureja) or [email](mailto:srishtigureja1110@gmail.com).
