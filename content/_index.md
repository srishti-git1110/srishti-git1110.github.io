### About
Hi there! My name is Srishti and I am a Research Scholar at Cohere.

I care the most about the following areas of study:
- Alignment of Language Models (For example: While, in theory, SFT teaches the models to lie and RLHF helps get around this by virtue of Reward Models, how well do RMs work **specifically** for this purpose?)
- Techniques for efficient training of and inference from Language Models
- Fast and Efficient Distributed Systems

I am a Statistics major and a self-taught Machine Learning Research Engineer. I am best reached via [twitter](https://twitter.com/sGx_tweets) or [email](mailto:srishtigureja1110@gmail.com).
