What does it mean to make decisions? Making decisions requires one to take into account the current circumstances and then take an action(s) with a goal to optimize the long term effects of the decision. RL is no different.\nI think it’s already nice to note that we’re talking about sequential decision making where the decisions taken today are relevant to the long term outcomes.\nThe way humans “learn” to make decisions using their life experiences is analogous to the “learning” part in Reinforcement Learning.\nBear with me for this analogy before we jump right into the foundational jargon needed to formally define the RL setup.\nAnalogy As humans, we live in an environment/world and we ought to make decisions at every point in our lives. If I state the obvious more explicity, I’d go: As humans, we need to make decisions all the time keeping in mind a few factors—the past until the present point in time, the present state of our lives, the immediate state our decision will land us in, both the short term gain received in response to our decision and also our long term goals, and so on. All of this is difficult because of one single fact—Uncertainty. Of what? Of the future. The future is uncertain and hence it’s hard to know in advance the actual outcome or the response from the world received by our actions.\nThis is really important. If this uncertainty wasn’t there, the science of decision making would’ve been much more simpler. At this point, it can also benefit to concretely define the two sources of uncertainty—the exact immediate/next state our current action/decision would land us in, and the gain that our current decision would yield immediately.\nFor example, consider an individual who currently needs to decide between accepting an admit to a graduate program and accepting a high paying job at a newly found startup. Let’s suppose their long term goal is to also build a startup of their own. Given that, their current decision needs to be the one that helps fulfill that goal in the most optimized manner. Hence, the two reasons why it’s hard to make this decision are:\nThe individual is uncertain of the benefit yielded by both decisions. Maybe the MS program yields more benefit via providing a strong knowledge base that could be leveraged to build a startup of maybe the job yields better benefit by providing strong hands-on exp!\nThe individual is also uncertain of the state both decisions land them in. Maybe the job environment as a fast paced startup quickly puts them in more senior or managerial positions that can be better for their own startup or maybe the MS programme would allow them to meet like-minded peers that could be their co-founders.\nAnd of course, this was my way of characterizing the problem. One could obviously define the benefit received and the next state differently.\nThe Jargon As noted, RL is the science of sequential decision making under uncertainty with a goal to optimize (of course, optimize here = maximize) the long term rewards. Mathematically, the RL problem can be defined using the following terms:\nAn agent. The state of the agent at any time step t st 𝜖 S where S is the state space defining all possible states the agent can be in. The action(s) taken by the agent at any time step t at 𝜖 A where A is the action space defining all possible actions that can be taken by the agent. The Policy followed by the agent according to which it acts. The environment the agent is interacting with. The setting goes: An agent is interacting with the environment. At any point in time t, the agent is in a state St and takes an action At. As a result of this, it receives some reward Rt from the environment and transitions to a new state St+1 both of which are defined by the environment.\nPolicy. Now, how does the agent know which action to take in which state? The Policy defines that. Mathematically, the policy is just the conditional probability distribution of s 𝜖 S given a 𝜖 A.\nThe policy is what’s learned by the agent.\n▶ The policy can either be stochastic or deterministic.\nStochastic Policy. Given a state s, a probability distribution can be defined over the action space A. enter expression here. i.e. In any state, the agent can take one or more actions depending on the probability of taking each as determined by the policy. Deterministic Policy. Given a state s, the agent will take only one action defined by the policy. enter exp Environment.\nReturn.\nValue Function.\nQ Function.\nGoal of the problem.\nHorizon.\nMarkov Reward Process (MRP) Markov Decision Process (MDP) Policy Evaluation and Policy Search (Iteration) Value Iteration ","wordCount":"816","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-06-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-06-10T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/blog/rl/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Srishti Gureja","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Srishti Gureja (Alt + H)">Srishti Gureja</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
