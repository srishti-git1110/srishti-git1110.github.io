Think about it…\nAlgorithmic complexity of Matrix Multiplication: Calculating the FLOPs required Matrix multiplication is ubiquitous in many areas of computer sciene. As the matrices grow in sizes, the amount of FLOPs required to calculate the matmul grow cubically1. Let’s see how.\nConsider two matrices $A (i \\times k)$ and $B (k \\times j)$. The product of $A$ and $B$, $AB$ is a matrix $C$ of shape $(i \\times j)$.\nFor simplicity and without loss of generality, let’s consider the matrices to be square so we have $A (n \\times n)$, $B (n \\times n)$ and their product $C (n \\times n)$. One element $(c_1, c_2)$ of $C$ is defined as:\n$$c_{c1,c2} = \\sum_{x=1}^{n} a_{c1,x} b_{x,c2}$$\nThis is a total of 2n - 1 floating point operations (FLOPs) required to calculate one element of C – $n$ multiplication ops + $(n-1)$ addition ops. A total of $n^2$ elements need to be calculated in $C$ and hence the total FLOPs:\n$$(2n - 1) n^2 = 2n^3 - n^2$$\nAs $n$ grows bigger (asymptomatic, if you’re feeling fancy), $n^2$ becomes pretty negligible in comparison to $2n^3$ and hence can be ignored so the total FLOPs required is roughly $2n^3$. Therefore, the computational complexity is $O(n^3)$.\nFor the purpose of this blog, I am keeping $n=4096$ which translates to roughly 137 GFLOPs. That’s seems like a lot of FLOPs, but is rather pretty small if compared with the peak FLOPs offered by any standard modern processor.\nTo benchmark, I calculate the time required to multiply two $4096 x 4096$ numpy arrays using np.matmul and it comes out to 0.1042s.\nNaive implementation The matmul loop is this:\nfor (int i = 0; i \u003c N; i++) { for (int j = 0; j \u003c N; j++) { for (int k = 0; k \u003c N; k++) { C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]; } } } When complied with the -O3 flag2 which is the maximum level with safe optimizations, the latency is 299.289 sec. Full compilation command below:\ngcc -Wall -O3 sgemm-cpu/matmuls/naive.c -o sgemm-cpu/matmuls/naive All the further optimizations use the same flags to compile the code.\nA minor optimization: Avoiding unnecessary memory accesses A very small thing we could do with the naive implementation is avoiding multiple reads and writes of intermediate partial sums from and to the memory/cache, like so:\nfor (int i = 0; i \u003c N; i++) { for (int j = 0; j \u003c N; j++) { float running_sum = 0.0; for (int k = 0; k \u003c N; k++) { running_sum += A[i][k] * B[k][j]; } C[i][j] = running_sum; } } That helps a bit and brings the latency down to 199.866s. This optimization is simply causing the compiler to keep the partial sum in the registers only and write back to the memory only once when the full sum is done. Meaning in this case the compiler isn’t issuing separate instructions to store the partial sum back to the memory after every loop iteration and to load it back on the next iteration; and that reduces some latency. 3\nLoop reordering The naive implementation follows the most natural mathy way to calculate a matmul $C = AB$ – element $C[0][0]$ is fully calculated first via a scalar product of the first row of $A$ with the first column of $B$. Element $C[0][1]$ is fully calculated next via the scalar product of the first row of $A$ with the second column of $B$, and so on.\nThere are two key insights over here:\nLanguages like C store matrices in the memory in a row major format like this: If we now follow the calculation of $C[0][0]$ in code, it’s equivalent to completing the inner-most $k$ loop for $i=0, j=0$.\nThe first part of the figure below uses 3 shades of red to color the values from $A, B, C$ that are accessed in the code during the calculation of $C[0][0]$. Focus on the location of these values in the memory by following the color.\nThe figure quickly makes it clear that the accessed values for $A, C$ are close to each other in the memory while they’re further apart for $B$. Now, remember that data is fetched from the memory in the caches in the granularity of cache lines. One cache line on my machine is of size 128 bytes which is equivalent to 32 single precision values.\nSo on the very first loop iteration $i=0, j=0, k=0$, when $A[0][0], B[0][0], C[0][0]$ are fetched from the memory, the cache looks something like:\nThis is simply because a cache line loads contiguous values from the memory where the matrices are stored in a row major format. On the second iteration $i=0, j=0, k=1$, we need $A[0][1], B[1][0], C[0][0]$ and while $A[0][1]$ and $C[0][0]$ are found in the cache, we have a miss for $B[1][0]$ that we need to fetch from the memory. And this holds for each iteration of the loop. Easy to figure out why – our cache line is only 128 bytes (32 floats) while each subsequent loop iteration accesses a value from B that’s 4096 values apart from the value accessed in the last iteration. And this high cache miss rate explains the high latency we saw w the naive implementation.\nThe second insight is not too difficult to understand – if we just change the loop orders (eg. $jik$ or $jki$ etc. instead of the most natural $ijk$), we’ll still get the correct matmul. It’s also why I was italicizing fully above. Thing is that with different loop orders we’re not fully calculating each element of C in one full iteration of the innermost loop but that doesn’t hurt the correctness of the matmul and that’s easy to realise. Alright. Given that, we note that some loop orders have a better overall cache hit rate as compared to the naive $ijk$ order (btw some orders also have a worse rate than $ijk$!). And hence just by changing the orders, we’ll be able to reduce the latency by not having to make as many high latency accesses to the memory. Experimenting w different orders, the lowest latency of 4.31s corresponds to order ikj down from 203.229s with order $ijk$ which is a ~45x improvement already! for (int i = 0; i \u003c N; i++) { for (int k = 0; k \u003c N; k++) { float a_ik = A[i][k]; for (int j = 0; j \u003c N; j++) { C[i][j] += a_ik * B[k][j]; } } } What was the bottleneck? A simple loop reordering of our naive implementation provided a 45 fold improvement. That’s a lot for such a simple change. What does this tell us? Obviously, we still performed total 137 GFLOPs so that part didn’t change. Turns out, in the naive implementation our bottleneck was the memory bandwidth. Meaning the CPU execution units (ALUs) were bottlenecked by the latency of data transfer between the memory and the CPU, implying we were overall memory bound in the naive implementation. Of course, we cannot change the memory bandwidth towards a faster memory. So what did we do? We simply wrote the code such that it allows for better cache reuse in subsequent loop iters!\nWhat about the computation aspect? // vectorization enabled by loop ordering - figured out by the compiler\nWhat about the minor optimization from above? No. Because with the reordered loops, we’re not calculating the full result $C[i][j]$ in one iteration of the inner most loop, we can’t avoid the loading and storing of partial sums anymore!\nTiling The long story short about tiling: it’s all about enabling a better cache reuse. Nothing different from the goal of loop reordering.\nLet’s try to understand tiling by doing something boring. For our best loop order $ikj$, we start by looking at the values that are accessed by the inner $k, j$ loops for different values of $i$.\n$(i=0, k=0-4095, j=0-4095)$\n$A[0][0], A[0][1], … A[0][4095]$ –\u003e A’s first row $C[0][0], C[0][1], … C[0][4095]$ –\u003e C’s first row $B[0][0], B[0][1], … B[0][4095]$ –\u003e B’s first row $B[1][0], B[1][1], … B[1][4095]$ –\u003e B’s second row … $B[4095][0], B[4095][1], … B[4095][4095]$ –\u003e B’s 4095th row $(i=1, k=0-4095, j=0-4095)$\n$A[1][0], A[1][1], … A[1][4095]$ –\u003e A’s second row $C[1][0], C[1][1], … C[1][4095]$ –\u003e C’s second row $B[0][0], B[0][1], … B[0][4095]$ –\u003e B’s first row $B[1][0], B[1][1], … B[1][4095]$ –\u003e B’s second row …\n$B[4095][0], B[4095][1], … B[4095][4095]$ –\u003e B’s 4095th row What do we infer?\n👉 At every iteration of the $i$ loop, the code accesses a different row of A and C but all the rows of B are accessed at each iteration.\nSo far so good. Let’s now take an example with smaller 8x8 matrices and see what caches actually look like with our best loop order. For the example, assume a fully associative cache following an LRU (least recently used) policy with a cache line of 32 bytes = 8 floats, and a cache size of 160 bytes = 5 cache lines.\nThe (terrible) figure below shows the values accessed in sequence for $i=0$, and the state of the cache at each step. Red denotes a cache miss requiring a cache update and blue denotes a cache hit with no cache update required. Note that by the time we end $k=2$ for, our cache is full.\nThe figure below shows the program resumed from $k=3$. Also shown is the cache state at the end of $i=0$ after multiple evictions. Note how the first 5 rows of B had to be evicted even before reaching $i=1$.\nNow what? Start $i=1$. The same story gets repeated and below are the various cache states showing how we need to load the entire B matrix from the memory to be able to finish $i=1$! Not even a single row found in cache when needed despite the fact that all of them were loaded in the previous iteration $i=0$.\nOf course, this was true for our particular example that no single row of B was found in the cache. In practice, the number of caches, their sizes, eviction policies, cache line sizes all matter in determining what rows/values are found but the general gist stated below remains the same.\nThe gist: At each new value of i, we’re having to load all or some rows (/partial rows depending on the cache line) of B from the high latency memory despite having them loaded in the previous iteration of i. We should definitely do better!\nThis is for the standard algorithm. There’s other algos like Strassen’s with better complexity. ↩︎\nExplore all optimization levels here. ↩︎\nSometimes, the compiler might also consider it safe to skip the extra store/reload steps when we directly update $C[i][j]$ in every loop iteration. But other times it may not. So, we’re just being explicit here and writing code such that the compiler would always consider it safe to not issue the extra store/reload instructions for the partial sums. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1870","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-12-20T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/blog/matmul-cpu/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Srishti Gureja","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Srishti Gureja (Alt + H)">Srishti Gureja</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">

This optimization is simply causing the compiler to keep the partial sum in the registers only and write back to the memory only once when the full sum is done. Meaning in this case the compiler isn&rsquo;t issuing separate instructions to store the partial sum back to the memory after every loop iteration and to load it back on the next iteration; and that reduces some latency. <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><h2 id=loop-reordering><a href=https://github.com/srishti-git1110/SGEMM-cpu/blob/main/sgemm-cpu/matmuls/cache_aware.c>Loop reordering</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#loop-reordering>#</a></h2><p>The naive implementation follows the most natural mathy way to calculate a matmul $C = AB$ &ndash; element $C[0][0]$ is <em>fully</em> calculated first via a scalar product of the first row of $A$ with the first column of $B$. Element $C[0][1]$ is <em>fully</em> calculated next via the scalar product of the first row of $A$ with the second column of $B$, and so on.</p><p>There are two key insights over here:</p><ol><li>Languages like C store matrices in the memory in a row major format like this:</li></ol><p><img loading=lazy src=row-major.jpeg alt="row major order"></p><p>If we now follow the calculation of $C[0][0]$ in code, it&rsquo;s equivalent to completing the inner-most $k$ loop for $i=0, j=0$.</p><p>The first part of the figure below uses 3 shades of red to color the values from $A, B, C$ that are accessed in the code during the calculation of $C[0][0]$. Focus on the location of these values in the memory by following the color.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=matmul-values-accessed.png alt="values accessed"></p><p>The figure quickly makes it clear that the accessed values for $A, C$ are close to each other in the memory while they&rsquo;re further apart for $B$. Now, remember that data is fetched from the memory in the caches in the granularity of cache lines. One cache line on my machine is of size 128 bytes which is equivalent to 32 single precision values.</p><p>So on the very first loop iteration $i=0, j=0, k=0$, when $A[0][0], B[0][0], C[0][0]$ are fetched from the memory, the cache looks something like:</p><p><img loading=lazy src=cache.png alt="cache after first iter"></p><p>This is simply because a cache line loads contiguous values from the memory where the matrices are stored in a row major format.
On the second iteration $i=0, j=0, k=1$, we need $A[0][1], B[1][0], C[0][0]$ and while $A[0][1]$ and $C[0][0]$ are found in the cache, we have a miss for $B[1][0]$ that we need to fetch from the memory. And this holds for each iteration of the loop. Easy to figure out why &ndash; our cache line is only 128 bytes (32 floats) while each subsequent loop iteration accesses a value from B that&rsquo;s 4096 values apart from the value accessed in the last iteration. And this high cache miss rate explains the high latency we saw w the naive implementation.</p><ol start=2><li>The second insight is not too difficult to understand &ndash; if we just change the loop orders (eg. $jik$ or $jki$ etc. instead of the most natural $ijk$), we&rsquo;ll still get the correct matmul. It&rsquo;s also why I was italicizing <em>fully</em> above. Thing is that with different loop orders we&rsquo;re not fully calculating each element of C in one full iteration of the innermost loop but that doesn&rsquo;t hurt the correctness of the matmul and that&rsquo;s easy to realise. Alright. Given that, we note that some loop orders have a better overall cache hit rate as compared to the naive $ijk$ order (btw some orders also have a worse rate than $ijk$!). And hence just by changing the orders, we&rsquo;ll be able to reduce the latency by not having to make as many high latency accesses to the memory. Experimenting w different orders, the lowest latency of 4.31s corresponds to order ikj down from 203.229s with order $ijk$ which is a ~45x improvement already!</li></ol><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-C data-lang=C><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>for</span> <span class=p>(</span><span class=kt>int</span> <span class=n>i</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=mi>0</span><span class=p>;</span> <span class=n>i</span> <span class=o>&lt;</span> <span class=n>N</span><span class=p>;</span> <span class=n>i</span><span class=o>++</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=p>{</span>

That&rsquo;s a lot for such a simple change. What does this tell us? Obviously, we still performed total 137 GFLOPs so that part didn&rsquo;t change. Turns out, in the naive implementation our bottleneck was the memory bandwidth. Meaning the CPU execution units (ALUs) were bottlenecked by the latency of data transfer between the memory and the CPU, implying we were overall <em>memory bound in the naive implementation</em>. Of course, we cannot change the memory bandwidth towards a faster memory. So what did we do?
